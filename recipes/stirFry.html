  <h2>Description</h2>
  Beef stir fry is a dish made by quickly cooking pieces of beef and vegetables in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. The ingredients are usually sliced or chopped into small, bite-sized pieces, and are cooked with a small amount of oil and a flavorful sauce.

  <li>Thinly sliced beef, such as sirloin or flank steak</li>
  <li>A selection of vegetables, such as bell peppers, onions, carrots, and broccoli</li>
  <li>A wok or large frying pan</li>
  <li>A small amount of oil, such as vegetable or peanut oil</li>
  <li>A stir fry sauce, which can be store-bought or homemade</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recipe</h2>
